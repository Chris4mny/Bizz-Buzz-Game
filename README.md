The purpose of this App is for you to continue practicing writing the syntax that causes your program to implement a loop and to see how the program behaves based on the loop’s logical expression being true or false.  This time the specifics of the loop are up to you! 
 
Another change this time.  The design for both parts is due one week and the working application is due the next week.  See the course schedule for specifics.

1	Bizz-Buzz 
 
Kids used to memorize the multiplication tables.  They learned their times 7 multiplication tables by first playing Bizz.  Variations of the game were also used to teach 2 through 9 multiplication tables.   
Bizz -  In Bizz, a group of students sat in a circle counting, with each saying the next number, in order, out loud.  The first student began with 1 and the game ended when the round reached 100.  When counting, each number is said out loud except the exact multiples of 7.  Each number that is an exact multiple of 7 is replaced in the round by the word “Bizz”.    
Buzz – Buzz is the same as Bizz except exact multiples of 4 are replaced with “Buzz”.  
Bizz-Buzz – Bizz-Buzz is the same except exact multiples of 7 are replaced with “Bizz”, exact multiples of 4 are replaced with “Buzz”, and exact multiples of both 7 and 4 are replaced with “Bizz-Buzz”. 
 
A	Determine the requirements and features for a game of Bizz 
B	Determine the requirements and features for a game of Buzz 
C	Determine the requirements and features for a game of Bizz-Buzz 
D	Design a program that fulfills the requirements of Bizz, Buzz, and Bizz-Buzz.   
E	In the constructor, allow the user to determine if s/he want to see Bizz, Buzz, or BizzBuzz.
